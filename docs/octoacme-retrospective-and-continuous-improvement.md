# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective

### Preparation (1 week before)
- Send calendar invite with [Sprint Retrospective Template](templates/sprint-retrospective-template.md)
- Gather metrics: velocity, burndown, cycle time, quality metrics
- Review previous action items and their outcomes

### Meeting Structure (45–75 minutes depending on team size)
1. **Check-in** (5 min): Quick round of how everyone is feeling
2. **Review Previous Actions** (10 min): Status update on last retrospective's action items
3. **Data Review** (10 min): Sprint metrics and key events
4. **Generate Insights** (20-30 min): What went well, what could be improved
   - Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
   - Group similar themes together
5. **Prioritize Actions** (10-15 min): Vote on top 2–3 action items to avoid overload
6. **Action Planning** (5-10 min): Define owners, timelines, and success criteria

### Meeting Facilitation Tips
- Rotate facilitator role among team members
- Focus on systems and processes, not individual blame
- Encourage specific, actionable suggestions over vague complaints
- Document decisions and next steps in real-time

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
