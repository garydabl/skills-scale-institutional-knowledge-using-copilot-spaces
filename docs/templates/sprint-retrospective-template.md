## Retrospective Facilitation Guide

### Pre-Meeting Preparation (Facilitator)
- [ ] Send calendar invite with agenda 3-4 days in advance
- [ ] Gather sprint metrics and data
- [ ] Review previous retrospective action items
- [ ] Prepare virtual whiteboard or collaboration tool
- [ ] Set up anonymous feedback collection if needed

### Meeting Structure (60-75 minutes)
1. **Check-in** (5 min): How is everyone feeling about the sprint?
2. **Sprint Review** (10 min): Share metrics and key events
3. **Previous Actions** (10 min): Review progress on last retrospective's items
4. **Generate Insights** (25-30 min): What went well, what to improve
5. **Prioritize Actions** (10-15 min): Vote on top improvements to pursue
6. **Plan Actions** (5-10 min): Define specific action items with owners

### Facilitation Tips
- **Encourage specific examples** over general statements
- **Focus on systems and processes**, not individual performance
- **Ask "why" questions** to get to root causes
- **Time-box discussions** to maintain energy and focus
- **Capture everything** but prioritize ruthlessly for action items
- **End on a positive note** with clear next steps

### Post-Meeting Actions
- [ ] Distribute notes within 24 hours
- [ ] Add action items to team backlog or tracking system
- [ ] Schedule check-ins for action item owners
- [ ] Update team improvement board or dashboard

*Remember: The goal is not just to identify problems, but to create specific, actionable changes that will improve team effectiveness.*
