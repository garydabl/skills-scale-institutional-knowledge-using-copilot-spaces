# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

## Overview

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This README provides a comprehensive overview of our project management processes, designed to help both new and existing team members understand how we deliver value efficiently and collaboratively.

## Our Approach

OctoAcme follows a **customer-first, iterative delivery model** with clear ownership and data-informed decisions. We prioritize psychological safety and continuous improvement across all projects.

### Core Principles
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning

## Key Workflows

### Project Lifecycle
Our projects follow a structured 5-phase approach:

1. **Initiation** → Problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline
2. **Planning** → Scope, resources, milestones, dependencies
3. **Execution** → Build, test, review, iterate
4. **Release** → Deploy, verify, announce
5. **Close & Retrospective** → Capture learnings and next steps

### Development Workflow
- **Project boards**: Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done
- **Pull Request standards**: Small PRs (≤400 lines), automated testing, required approvals
- **Quality gates**: Unit tests, integration tests, security scanning, manual QA

## Core Roles & Responsibilities

### Project Manager (PM)
- **Focus**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications
- **Goals**: Deliver on time and within scope, minimize escalations, maintain transparency
- **Key activities**: Project plans, risk management, stakeholder coordination

### Product Manager (PdM)
- **Focus**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success
- **Goals**: Maximize customer value, make data-driven decisions, ensure product-market fit
- **Key activities**: Problem statements, roadmap prioritization, success metrics

### Developers
- **Focus**: Design, build, test, and deliver software components
- **Goals**: Deliver reliable code, reduce cycle time, maintain high quality
- **Key activities**: Feature implementation, code reviews, technical design

### QA/Testing
- **Focus**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Goals**: Ensure reliability and user experience standards
- **Key activities**: Test planning, acceptance validation, quality assurance

## Communication Strategies

### Regular Cadences
- **Daily standups** (15 min): Progress, blockers, dependencies
- **Weekly PM + PdM sync**: Alignment and decision-making
- **Twice-weekly team standups**: Delivery team coordination
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Progress and strategic alignment
- **Sprint demos**: Feature showcases and feedback collection

### Communication Templates
- **Weekly Status**: Progress, next steps, risks & blockers, decisions needed
- **Incident Communication**: Triage summary, actions, timeline, retrospective
- **Release Notes**: Summary, notable changes, migration steps, known issues

### Escalation Paths
- **Level 1**: Team-level triage in daily standup
- **Level 2**: PM escalates to Product Lead and dependent teams
- **Level 3**: Sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues

## Quality Assurance Practices

### Pre-Release Requirements
- All acceptance criteria met and PRs merged
- Passing CI and security scans
- Release notes drafted and rollback plan documented
- Smoke tests prepared and executed

### Testing Standards
- **Unit tests** for new logic
- **Integration tests** where applicable
- **End-to-end smoke tests** for critical flows
- **Security scanning** in CI pipeline
- **Manual QA** for feature acceptance

### Risk Management
We maintain a **Risk Register** tracking:
- Impact and likelihood assessments
- Mitigation plans and owners
- Regular monitoring and status updates
- Proactive identification during planning and execution

## Key Artifacts

Every project maintains these essential documents:
- **Project Charter/One-pager**: Problem, goal, success metrics
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline and milestone mapping
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Register**: Risk tracking and mitigation strategies
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and continuous improvement actions

## Continuous Improvement

### Retrospective Process
- **Frequency**: After each sprint, release, or milestone
- **Structure**: What went well, improvements needed, actionable items
- **Follow-up**: Track action items in project backlog with clear owners

### Success Measurement
- **Velocity tracking** and burndown monitoring
- **Success metrics** from Project One-pager
- **Key signals dashboard** (errors, latency, usage)
- **Impact measurement** of improvement actions

## Getting Started

### For New Team Members
1. **Day 1: Initial Setup**
   - Review this overview and the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)
   - Complete the [New Team Member Onboarding Checklist](templates/onboarding-checklist.md)
   - Set up development environment following team-specific setup guides
   
2. **Week 1: Role Alignment**
   - Understand your [role and responsibilities](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)
   - Schedule 1:1 meetings with your manager and key team members
   - Join relevant Slack channels and distribution lists
   
3. **Week 1-2: Process Integration**
   - Familiarize yourself with [communication processes](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)
   - Join relevant standups and weekly syncs
   - Shadow existing team members in meetings and code reviews
   - Complete first small task/bug fix to learn the development workflow

### For Project Initiation
1. Start with [Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)
2. Create Project One-pager and align stakeholders
3. Move to [Planning phase](octoacme-project-planning.md) once approved
4. Follow [Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) during delivery
